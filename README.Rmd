The `{ffsimulator}` package uses bootstrap resampling to run fantasy football season simulations supported by historical rankings and nflfastR data, calculating optimal lineups, and returning aggregated results. This can quickly run your league through hundreds of seasons and builds out the data to help you study:

-   expected season finishes and range of outcomes
-   player contributions to season wins
-   roster constructions
-   effects of (potential) trades
-   and more!

This package is part of the [ffverse](https://www.ffverse.com) family of R packages for fantasy football analysis.

## Installation

Install the stable version of this package from CRAN:

```{r}
install.packages("ffsimulator")
```

Install the development version from either [r-universe](https://ffverse.r-universe.dev) or GitHub:

```{r}
install.packages(
  "ffsimulator", 
  repos = c("https://ffverse.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos"))
)
# pak is recommended, see https://github.com/r-lib/pak
pak::pak("ffverse/ffsimulator")
# can also use remotes
remotes::install_github("ffverse/ffsimulator")
```

The development version has a [separate documentation site here](https://ffsimulator.ffverse.com/dev/).

## Usage

A season simulation can be run as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ffsimulator)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)

mfl_conn <- mfl_connect(season = 2021, league_id = 22627)

## OTHER PLATFORM CONNECTIONS MAY BE USED, FOR EXAMPLE:
# sleeper_conn <- sleeper_connect(season = 2021,  league_id = "652582284720971776")
# flea_conn <- fleaflicker_connect(season = 2021, league_id = 312861)
# espn_conn <- espn_connect(season = 2021, league_id = 899513)

mfl_sim <- ff_simulate(conn = mfl_conn, n_seasons = 100)

plot(mfl_sim)
```
