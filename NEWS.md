# ffsimulator (development version)

- Add start of `ff_wins_added()` calculation (v1.1.0.01)
- Add return argument to ff_simulate and ff_simulate_week to control return of more contents ("default" vs "all")
- Refactor verbose argument to primarily use the package option rather than the argument pattern
- Add replacement level function and calculation (v1.1.0.02)

# ffsimulator 1.1.0

This release of ffsimulator adds new features and refactors a lot of the backend for improved calculation efficiency.

## New features

- `ff_simulate_week()` is a new function (and supporting internal function family) that simulates upcoming inseason weeks with daily-updated upcoming week ranks.
- `ff_simulate()` gains an `actual_schedule` argument to simulate actual schedule + unplayed games.
- `ff_simulate()` and `ff_simulate_week()` gain a `verbose` argument that is set ON by default and can also be turned off with `options(ffsimulator.verbose = FALSE)`
- `ffs_copy_template()` helps build custom simulations by copying a template of starter code to a desired filepath.
- Simulations now support kickers (you can thank SFB for that!) and gain a `pos_filter` argument.

## Backend changes

Many backend changes - some are breaking (***grimaces and points at the experimental badge***).

- Parallel options removed in favour of data.table options. ***BREAKING*** - parallel is gone.
- Column assertions should be clearer on each error message.
- Many functions, including `ffs_optimise_lineups()`, `ffs_score_rosters()`, and more are now written in data.table - this helps improve speed for all sizes of simulations. 
- `injury_model` argument is now renamed to `gp_model`. ***BREAKING*** - argument name changed.
- `autoplot()` refactored to hide legend and axis titles via geom/scale and not via theme - this allows for much easier theming (since you can apply a whole new theme via `+`).
- `ffs_build_schedules()` now matches syntax from `ffscrapr::ff_schedule()` - `team` is now `franchise_id` and `opponent` is now `opponent_id` - ***BREAKING*** - output column names changed.
- `ffs_build_schedules()` is now responsible for joining franchises to the schedule, and not `ffs_summarise_week()`, and now takes a franchises dataframe as created by `ffs_franchises()` ***BREAKING***
- `ffs_repeat_schedules()` supports the actual_schedule feature by repeating it by `n_seasons`.
- Print methods cleaned up.

Immensely grateful to everyone who used and shared the first release of this package - it's been very motivating!

# ffsimulator 1.0.0

The `ffsimulator` package uses bootstrap resampling to run fantasy football season simulations supported by historical rankings and nflfastR data, calculating optimal lineups, and returning aggregated results.

This initial release introduces two major functions:

-   `ff_simulate()` (runs the main simulation)
-   `autoplot()` (visualizes the output of the simulation)

and also introduces a suite of subfunctions that power the main simulation, mostly prefixed with `ffs_`

-   `ffs_latest_rankings()`
-   `ffs_rosters()`
-   `ffs_adp_outcomes()`
-   `ffs_generate_projections()`
-   `ffs_score_rosters()`
-   `ffs_optimise_lineups()`
-   `ffs_build_schedules()`
-   `ffs_summarise_week()`
-   `ffs_summarise_season()`
-   `ffs_summarise_simulation()`

Finally, this first version includes two dataframes:

-   `fp_rankings_history` provides historical expert consensus rankings from 2012-2020
-   `fp_injury_table` calculates the odds of a player playing in any given game

Other features developed for initial release include:

-   `ffs_adp_outcomes()` bins together nearby ranks to broaden the bootstrapping sample
-   Bye week handling
-   Invalid lineups in `ffs_optimise_lineups()`
-   Unit and integration testing

Features postponed to subsequent versions:

-   Progress bar for verbose output
-   Investigating speedup packages for higher volumes
-   Using real ff_schedules rather than simulated schedules
-   Support for kicker scoring
